this was made to make it easier to:
- read emails that have a particular subject
- extract some data from the email body (made of text with pipe '|' separated values)
- find a string located in the email body
- save the email as a pdf and use that string to name the file.
- Get the email body, append it to a (html) file.
- format the html file to highlight some parts and make it easier to read for human eyes.
